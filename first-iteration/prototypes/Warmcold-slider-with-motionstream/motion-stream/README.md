# This code is based on Clint's motionstream tutorial
Added functionality that changes the backgroundcolor
between 4 stages of warm to cold light depending on
the horizontal orientation of the connected mobile
device.

# How to set it up
1. Open the directory in powershell/terminal and type 'npm install'
2. Boot the server with 'npm start'
3. Open 'localhost:8080' in your browser and http:/[IP]:8080/mobile.html on a phone.
4. Tilt the phone and watch as the colors change on your computer.
