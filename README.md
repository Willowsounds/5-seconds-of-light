# 5-seconds-of-light
Group 5 PP/P2 Final Project 
Content: 
- ClintH tutorial that we have tried and got working on our laptops
- First iteration: some digital sketches for our prototypes that use arduino or serial-bridge
- Second iteration: digital sketches of our prototypes that use motion-stream or serial-bridge

**What is the project exploring**
The project is exploring different interactions that users can experience in a changing room in a clothes store if they want to change the light. 

**First iteration folders content:**
- potentiometer sketches use serial brigde and they were used in two physical prototypes: the potentiometer knob and the slider (Dressing from dawn till dusk concept);
- four buttons sketches use arduino and html, they were used in: laser cut buttons and floor pedals (Four weddings and a funeral & Twister in the changing room concepts);
**Prototypes sub-folder worth mentioning** 
- warm cold slider: digital sketch and prototype that uses touch screen;
- warm cold slider with motionstream: changes the backgroundcolor between 4 stages of warm to cold light depending on the horizontal orientation of the connected mobile device;
- joystick interaction: arduino and html/javascript that controls the computer mouse with a joystick;

**Second iteration folder** 
- warm cold slider with motionstream 2: related concept: Instastory, updated code by adding the Y axis from the phone to change the color;
- adding more buttons: four weddings and a funeral concept: uses laser cut buttons and serial bridge to communicate and change colors on the screen, also: html file is updated;
- potentiometer works: updated the way colors are changed in the code;
- ultrasound: related concept: Touch me not; uses serial bridge and a distance sensor that changes the color on the screen based on the distance between the users hand and the sensor.
