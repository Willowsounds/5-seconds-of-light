# This code is based on code written by Jontas (http://www.f15ijp.com/2012/09/arduino-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04-or-hy-srf05/)

# This is a distance measurement prototype that uses serial bridge to get data from the physical distance sensor into a browser window. When the data is received and proccessed, the accurate colour change occurs.

# How to set up:
1. see README.md in 5-seconds-of-light/ClintH tutorials/ serial-bridge and follow the instructions there
2. hook up the distance measurement sensor to Arduino board
3. upload Arduino code to the Arduino board
4. move your hand up and down to see colour change in your browser window
