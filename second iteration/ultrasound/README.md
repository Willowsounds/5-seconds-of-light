This code is based on code written by Jontas (http://www.f15ijp.com/2012/09/arduino-ultrasonic-sensor-hc-sr04-or-hy-srf05/)

This is a distance measurement prototype that uses serial bridge to get data from the physical distance sensor into a browser window. When the data is received and proccessed, the accurate colour change occurs.

How to set up:
-see README.md in 5-seconds-of-light/ClintH tutorials/ serial-bridge and follow the instructions there
-hook up the distance measurement sensor to Arduino board
-upload Arduino code to the Arduino board
-move your hand up and down to see colour change in your browser window
